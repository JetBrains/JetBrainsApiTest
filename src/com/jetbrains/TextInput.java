/**
 * This is a JBR API for text-input related functionality for applications that implement custom text components.
 * <p>
 * Suppose an application implements a custom text component called {@code CustomTextComponent}, that
 * doesn't inherit from {@link java.awt.TextComponent} or {@link javax.swing.text.JTextComponent}.
 * For this component to work correctly, the application needs to handle certain events that are missing from
 * the Java specification.
 * <p>
 * To do this, the application should add an event listener for the events provided by this API.
 * This is best done at application startup time, since the event listener is global, and not per-component.
 * For example, this would be a proper way to implement this event handler for {@code CustomTextComponent}:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * var textInput = JBR.getTextInput();
 * if (textInput != null) {
 *     textInput.setGlobalEventListener(new TextInput.EventListener() {
 *         @Override
 *         public void handleSelectTextRangeEvent(TextInput.SelectTextRangeEvent event) {
 *             if (event.getSource() instanceof CustomTextComponent) {
 *                 ((CustomTextComponent)event.getSource()).select(event.getBegin(), event.getBegin() + event.getLength());
 *             }
 *         }
 *     });
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * This assumes that {@code CustomTextComponent} has a method called {@code select}, that selects a text range,
 * similar to the {@link java.awt.TextComponent#select(int, int)} and {@link javax.swing.text.JTextComponent#select(int, int)}.
 * See {@link TextInput.SelectTextRangeEvent} for more information.
